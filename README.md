# GrishinsGhouls [G.G.]
Main repositry for Grishin's Ghouls, a top-down shooter which is stylistically a combination of The Secret War and Helldivers. Assets sourced either freely online or made indepentently via Blender. Game created using Godot game engine v.4.


# Basic Usage
In order to utilise the Godot assets within this file, the user must have the latest version of Godot installed, which can be found [here](https://godotengine.org/). Once this has been installed, the user may import a project via the `project.godot` file at the root of each asset.

# Additional Notes
The open_source_assets are listed with their sources where possible. Additionally, the open_source_assets folder does not contain any `project.godot` type files that may be imported via Godot as functional pieces. Rather, they are intended as additional resources for future development. 

# Open Source Assets List
  - [*Kenney's prototype textures*](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/prototype-textures)
  - [*Lukky's RPG assets*](https://github.com/lukky-nl/RPG_assets)
  - [*Mixamo basic char rig*](https://www.mixamo.com/#/)

Every attempt will be made to add additional resources to this list as they become added to the project.
