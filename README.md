# GrishinsGhouls [G.G.]
Main repositry for Grishin's Ghouls, a top-down shooter which is stylistically a combination of The Secret War and Helldivers. Assets sourced either freely online or made indepentently via Blender. Game created using Godot game engine v.4.


# Basic Usage
In order to utilise the Godot assets within this file, the user must have the latest version of Godot installed, which can be found [here](https://godotengine.org/). Once this has been installed, the user may import a project via the `project.godot` file at the root of each asset.

# Additional Notes
The open_source_assets are listed with their sources where possible. Additionally, the open_source_assets folder does not contain any `project.godot` type files that may be imported via Godot as functional pieces. Rather, they are intended as additional resources for future development.
